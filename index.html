	<h1>Week 1 - Intro to HTML</h1>
	<p>We are going to start out this week learning about the basics of text markup to create HTML pages. If you want to look ahead, I am going to be using Jeri Wieringa's examples from HILT 2014. Those examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/jerielizabeth/HILT-Code-Examples">here</a>.
	<p>Also, this is a HTML page with no CSS styling or JavaScript. We will also build on it as the year goes on!</p>
